# Tell Me About Yourself

## Intro

Hello, my name is Timothy Shores. I am a software engineer associate at Optum, a subsidiary of Fortune 5 company UnitedHealth Group.

## Background Before Tech

A quick background about myself, I majored in economics in college because I enjoyed both systems thinking and quantitative reasoning came naturally to me.

After I graduated from Illinois State University, I attended DePaul University's Predictive Analytics graduate degree program. I planned on studying data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In between graduating from Illinois State University in December and the start of the Spring quarter at DePaul, I organized a concert with a friend for over 1,000 attendees.

Combining my passion for entrepreneurship, live events, and music, I dropped out of the grad school program when I was 25 to focus on building a bushiness in the real world rather than continue my studies.

While I enjoyed building a business based on my passions, I eventually wanted more long term stability and predictability in my career and personal finances.

I didn't want to go back to school for another twos years full-time to complete my masters degrees. Instead I opted for a full-stack web development bootcamp. I enjoyed programming and computer science because it reminded me of the systems thinking and quantitative reasoning from my economics major in college.

## Work Experience in Tech

I joined Optum after graduating from BloomTech's nine month long full-time full-stack web development and computer science coding bootcamp. I joined Optum through an entry level rotational program along with recent graduates from computer science majors in both undergraduate and graduate level programs.
