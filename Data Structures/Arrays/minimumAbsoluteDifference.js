// Prompt
// Given an array of unique integers, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference. If there are multiple pairs, return them in ascending order.

//  Runtime
// Expected Time Complexity: O(N log N) to traverse the length N array and organize it
// Expected Space Complexity: O(N) to store up to N elements

// Examples
// Input: arr = [1,3,6,10,15]
// Output: [[1,3]]
// Explanation: There is only 1 pair of elements with a minimum absolute difference of 2.

// Input: arr = [3,8,-10,23,19,-4,-14,27]
// Output: [[-14,-10],[19,23],[23,27]]
// Explanation: There are 3 pairs of elements with a minimum absolute difference of 4 which are listed in ascending order according to the smaller value in the pair.

// Input: arr = [4,2,1,3]
// Output: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
// Explanation: There are 3 pairs of elements with a minimum absolute difference of 1 which are listed in ascending order according to the smaller value in the pair.

const minAbsDiffPairs = (arr) => {};
