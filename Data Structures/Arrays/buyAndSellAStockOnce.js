// Prompt
// Given an array of floats that represents the movement in the share price of a company over time, design an algorithm that determines the maximum profit that could have been made by buying and then selling a single share over the time period. The buy must occur before the sell.

// Expected Runtime
// Time: O(N) to iterate through the length N array once
// Space: O(1) to use a constant amount of variables for any array length

// Examples
// Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

// Input: prices = [5, 7, 8, 9, 3, 1, 6]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
// Note: buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

// Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

const maxProfitPotential = (prices) => {};
