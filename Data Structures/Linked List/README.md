# Linked Lists
-----
Linked Lists are a data structure that contain a value and a reference to the next element in the Linked List

Appending to a Linked List is O(1) constant time since we just have to set the .next property to the head or .next from the tail node to the new node.

Accessing the Kth element in a Linked List is O(K) linear time since we need to iterate to the Kth element.

Each node in a Linked List needs a value and a reference to the next node in the Linked List.
