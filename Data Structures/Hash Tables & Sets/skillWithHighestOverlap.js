// Prompt
// Given an input dictionary mapping from the name of Fellows to their numerical skill rating, return the skill rating with the highest number of Fellows.

// Expected Time Complexity: O(N) to iterate through N dictionary entries
// Expected Space Complexity: O(N) to store up to N skill levels

// Example
// {"oliver": 3, "pixel": 1, "pinky": 3} => 3

const highestSkillOverlap = (fellowSkills) => {};
