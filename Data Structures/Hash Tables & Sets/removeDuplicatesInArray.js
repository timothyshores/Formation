// A bug in the Formation session tool accidentally duplicated some Fellows in sessions. Given an array of names representing Fellows in a session, return an array of the distinct Fellows. The array must be in the same order as the input.

// Follow-up question:
// How would removing the Fellows in place, instead of using a new output array, affect the algorithm's runtime?

// Expected Time Complexity: O(N) to iterate through the length N array
// Expected Space Complexity: O(N) to store up to N elements

// Example
// ["oliver", "pixel", "oliver", "pinky"] will return ["oliver", "pixel", "pinky"]

const removeDuplicateFellows = (fellows) => {};
