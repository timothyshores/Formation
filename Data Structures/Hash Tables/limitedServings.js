// You're a bartender, and you have to look out for your patrons - you don't want them to drink too much. Assume everyone is having the same drink, and everyone has the same set amount of "allowed servings".

// Given an array of patrons (denoted by their names, eg: Adrian), and an integer value representing "allowed servings", return True if someone attempts to go over the allowed number of servings per person.

// Otherwise, False if no one drinks too much.

// Can you think of any data structures that might help?

// Expected Runtime
// Time: O(N) where N = # of total interactions (non-unique patrons)
// Space: O(N) to store up to N patrons

const limitedServings = (patrons, allowedServings) => {};
