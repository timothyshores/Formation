❓ PROMPT
Given a non-negative int n, return the count of the occurrences of 7 as a digit, so for example 717 yields 2. (no loops).

Note that mod (%) by 10 yields the rightmost digit (126 % 10 is 6), while integer division by 10 removes the rightmost digit Math.floor(126 / 10) returns 12. 

Example(s)
count7(7) == 1
count7(123) == 0
count7(717) == 2
