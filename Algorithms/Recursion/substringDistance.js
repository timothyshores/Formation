/*
❓ PROMPT
Given a string and a non-empty substring *sub*, compute recursively the size of the largest substring which starts and ends with the given *sub* string and return its length, including the length of the substrings. When *sub* is multiple characters, they may overlap with each other and share characters.

Example(s)
strDist("catcowcat", "cat") == 9
strDist("catcowcat", "cow") == 3
strDist("cccatcowcatxx", "cat") == 9
strDist("ooowhwhwooo", "whw") == 5
