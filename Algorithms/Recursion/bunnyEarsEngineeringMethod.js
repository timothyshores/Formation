❓ PROMPT
We have a number of bunnies, each with two big floppy ears. We want to compute the total number of ears across all the bunnies recursively, without loops or multiplication.

Example(s)
bunnyEars(3) == 6
bunnyEars(5) == 10

🔎 EXPLORE
State your assumptions & discoveries:
· Every bunny has two ears
· Return the total count of bunny ears 
· Every count is 2 ears

Create examples & test cases:

console.log(bunnyEars(0) === 0); 
console.log(bunnyEars(1) === 2); 
console.log(bunnyEars(2) === 4); 
console.log(bunnyEars(3) === 6); 
console.log(bunnyEars(4) === 8); 
console.log(bunnyEars(5) === 10); 
console.log(bunnyEars(10) === 20); 
console.log(bunnyEars(50) === 100); 
console.log(bunnyEars(69) === 138); 
console.log(bunnyEars(101) === 202);
