❓ PROMPT
Given a string and a non-empty substring **sub**, compute recursively if at least n copies of sub appear in the string somewhere, possibly with overlapping. N will be non-negative.

Example(s)
strCopies("catcowcat", "cat", 2) == True
strCopies("catcowcat", "cow", 2) == False
strCopies("catcowcat", "cow", 1) == True

🔎 EXPLORE
State your assumptions & discoveries:
The function will count the number of times that a substring appears within a given string
If the substring appears n number of times or more return true
Else return false
