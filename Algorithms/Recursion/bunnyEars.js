// Prompt
// We have a number of bunnies, each with two big floppy ears. We want to compute the total number of ears across all the bunnies recursively, without loops or multiplication.

// Expected Runtime
// Time: O(n) where n is the number of bunnies
// Space: O(n) where n is the number of stack frames because one is created for each bunny

// Examples
// console.log(bunnyEars(3) === 6); // true
// console.log(bunnyEars(5) === 10); // true

const bunnyEars = (bunnies) => {};
