/*

Given an integer *maxLen*, print all binary strings of size *maxLen* that don't have 1s next to each other. That is, no string should contain the substring 11, 111, 1111, 11111, etc. You can assume *maxLen* > 0.

EXAMPLE(S)
printBinaryWithoutConsecutive1s(maxLen=2)
00
01
10

printBinaryWithoutConsecutive1s(maxLen=3)
000
001
010
100
101

const printBinaryWithoutConsecutive1s = (maxLen) => {};
