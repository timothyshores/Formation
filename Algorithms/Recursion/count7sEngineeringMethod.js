❓ PROMPT
Given a non-negative int n, return the count of the occurrences of 7 as a digit, so for example 717 yields 2. (no loops).

Note that mod (%) by 10 yields the rightmost digit (126 % 10 is 6), while integer division by 10 removes the rightmost digit (126 / 10 is 12). Be aware that some languages require some special handling to do integer division while others do not.

*Python integer division*: x // y
*Javascript integer division*: Math.floor(x / y)

Example(s)
count7(7) == 1
count7(123) == 0
count7(717) == 2
