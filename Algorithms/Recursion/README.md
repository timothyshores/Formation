# Recursion

----

Recursion is a function that calls itself in order to solve sub-problems which in result solve the main problem.

Recursion requires a base case,  a recursive case and then combines smaller sub problems to solve a large more general problem.

Linked Lists are recursive data structures. When you iterate through the LL the LL becomes a smaller subset of the original problem.

Trees are another data structure that works well with recursion because the left or right child node is also a tree as well. Trees can be thought of as two dimensional linked lists.
