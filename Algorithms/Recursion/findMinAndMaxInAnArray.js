❓ PROMPT
Given an array, write 2 recursive functions to find the minimum and maximum element in an array. You may use the *min(a,b)* and *max(a,b)* functions to shorthand picking the minimum and maximum between 2 values.

Example(s)
findMin([12, 1234, 45, 67, 1]) == 1
findMin([10, 20, 30]) == 10
findMin([8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 7]) == 3

findMax([12, 1234, 45, 67, 1]) == 1234
findMax([10, 20, 30]) == 30
findMax([8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 7]) == 8
