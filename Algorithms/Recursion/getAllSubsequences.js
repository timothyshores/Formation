/*
❓ PROMPT
Define a subsequence of a string s to be a list of characters from s such that the characters appear in the same order in the list and in s.
For instance, for the string abcd, a, ab, and acd are valid subsequences, whereas db is not, since b comes before d in the original string.
Given an input string, return all subsequences of the string except the empty string.

Example
console.log(getAllSubsequences("abc")); // ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]

🔎 EXPLORE
State your assumptions & discoveries: 

Want to output all unique permutations of the input string

Create examples & test cases:

console.log(getAllSubsequences("")); // [""]
console.log(getAllSubsequences("a")); // ["a"]
console.log(getAllSubsequences("ab")); // ["a, b, ab"]
