❓ PROMPT
Euclid's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers *a* and *b* is:

euclidGCD(a, 0) := a
euclidGCD(a, b) := gcd(b, a mod b) 

Write a function that implements Euclid's algorithm and finds the GCD of two numbers. 

Check out this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwf6ncRmhPg
for more information on this very old algorithm.

Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm also has a formal write-up.

Example(s)
euclidGCD(9, 27) == 9
euclidGCD(27, 9) == 9
euclidGCD(3, 1) == 1
