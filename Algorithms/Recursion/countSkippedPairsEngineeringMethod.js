❓ PROMPT
We'll say that a "skipped pair" in a string is two instances of a char separated by a char. So "AxA" the A's make a pair. Pair's can overlap, so "AxAxA" contains 3 skipped pairs -- 2 for A and 1 for x. Recursively compute the number of skipped pairs in the given string.

Example(s)
countSkippedPairs("axa") == 1
countSkippedPairs("axax") == 2
countSkippedPairs("aaa") == 1
