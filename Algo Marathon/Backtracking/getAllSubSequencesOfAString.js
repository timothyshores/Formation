❓ PROMPT
Define a subsequence of a string "s" to be a list of characters from "s" such that the characters appear in the same order in the list and in "s".

For instance, for the string "abcd", "a", "ab", and "acd" are valid subsequences, whereas "db" is not, since "b" comes before "d" in the original string.

Given an input string, return all subsequences except the empty string.

Example(s)
getAllSubsequences("abc") ==["a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"]
