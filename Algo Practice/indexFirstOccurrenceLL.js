❓ PROMPT
Given a linked list and a target value, return the index of the first occurrence of that value in the linked list. The index should be zero-indexed.

You'll need to write your own node class for this. In an interview it might be provided or it might not.

Example(s)
list1 = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

firstIndexInLL(list1, 9) == -1
firstIndexInLL(list1, 3) == 2
