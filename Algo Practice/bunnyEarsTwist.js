❓ PROMPT
We have bunnies standing in a line, numbered 1, 2, ... The odd bunnies (1, 3, ..) have the usual 2 ears. The even bunnies (2, 4, ..) we'll say have 3 ears because they each have a raised foot. Recursively return the number of "ears" in the bunny line 1, 2, ... n (without loops or multiplication).

Example(s)
bunnyEarsTwist(2) == 5
bunnyEarsTwist(3) == 7
bunnyEarsTwist(5) == 12

🔎 EXPLORE
List your assumptions & discoveries:
- Odd bunnies have 2 ears
- Even bunnies have 3 ears

Insightful & revealing test cases:
bunnyEarsTwist(0) == 0
bunnyEarsTwist(1) == 2
bunnyEarsTwist(2) == 5
bunnyEarsTwist(3) == 7
bunnyEarsTwist(4) == 10
bunnyEarsTwist(5) == 12
bunnyEarsTwist(10) == 25
bunnyEarsTwist(12) == 30

Outline of algorithm #: 1

Base Case
If bunnies is 0 return 0

Recursive cases
- If number is odd add 2 else number is even add 3
- Recursively call bunnyEarsTwist(bunnies -1)
