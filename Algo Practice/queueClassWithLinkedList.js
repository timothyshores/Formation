‚ùì PROMPT
Implement a basic queue class using a linked list as the underlying storage. Queues have two critical methods, enqueue() and dequeue() to add and remove an item from the queue, respectively. You'll also need a constructor for your class, and for convenience, add a size() method that returns the current size of the queue. All of these methods should run in O(1) time!

Remember, a queue is a first-in, first-out (or last-in, last-out) data structure!

A doubly linked list is one of the simplest ways to implement a queue. You'll need both a head and tail pointer to keep track of where to add and where to remove data. This can be done with a singly linked list or doubly linked list. Which do you prefer?

Example(s)
q = new LLQueue();
console.log(q.size()) // 0
q.enqueue(2); // 2
q.enqueue(3); // 3 -> 2
console.log(q.size()) // 2
console.log(q.dequeue()); // 2
console.log(q.size()) // 1
console.log(q.dequeue()); // 3
 

üîé EXPLORE
List your assumptions & discoveries:
- Create a linked list class
  - Linked lists node contain 2 properties
    - Store data or a value
    - A pointer to the next node

- Implement a queue class with the following methods
  - enqueue() 
    - Add new node to either the head or tail of the LL
  - dequeue() 
    - Remove node from either the head or tail of the LL
    - If LL is empty then retirn undefined
  - size()
    - Returns the number of elements in the LL
- All operations need to run in O(1) time
  - E.g. need doubly linked list or a pointer at the head, node before tail and tail
