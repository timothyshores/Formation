‚ùì PROMPT
You will be implementing a function called stringify which will take in a Javascript Object and return the JSON representation of the object as a string.
This function is actually built into Javascript as `JSON.stringify(object)` but you have to write yours from scratch!

You may want to take a moment to review the rules for [JSON syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_syntax.asp).

Example(s)

Examples:
- Input: {"x": 5, "y": "Oliver"}
  Output: '{"x": 5, "y": "Oliver"}'

- Input: [1, "hello", "null", {"x": 5, "y": "Oliver"}]
  Output: '[1, "hello", "null", {"x": 5, "y": "Oliver"}]'

A brief note about the input and output. They look very similar, but the input is an object and the output is a string enclosed in single ticks. This means that the double quotes inside that string are characters in the string and are important.
 
üîé EXPLORE
List your assumptions & discoveries:

Want to iterate over all key value pairs
Input can be either objects or arrays
- Objects should be wrapped in {}
- Arrays should be wrapped in []
Objects and or arrays can be nested within each other
Output will be wrapped in quotes to return as a string

Insightful & revealing test cases:

Empty objects and arrays
stringify({}) // '{}'
stringify([]) // '[]'

Objects and arrays with single entry
stringify({1: 'a'}) // '{}'
stringify([1]) // '[1]'
stringify(['a']) // '['a']'

Flat Objects and Arrays
stringify([1, 2, 3]) // '[1, 2, 3]'
stringify(['a', 'b', 'c']) // '['a', 'b', 'c']'
stringify({"x": 5, "y": "Oliver"}) // '{"x": 5, "y": "Oliver"}'

Nested objects and arrays
stringify([1, "hello", "null", {"x": 5, "y": "Oliver"}]) // '[1, "hello", "null", {"x": 5, "y": "Oliver"}]'
 

üß† BRAINSTORM
What approaches could work?
Algorithm 1: Recursion
Time: O(N) where N is the number of elements within the object
Space: O(N) where N is the number of elements within the object
