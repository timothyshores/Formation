❓ PROMPT
You will be implementing a function called stringify which will take in a Javascript Object and return the JSON representation of the object as a string.
This function is actually built into Javascript as `JSON.stringify(object)` but you have to write yours from scratch!

You may want to take a moment to review the rules for [JSON syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_syntax.asp).

Example(s)

Examples:
- Input: {"x": 5, "y": "Oliver"}
  Output: '{"x": 5, "y": "Oliver"}'

- Input: [1, "hello", "null", {"x": 5, "y": "Oliver"}]
  Output: '[1, "hello", "null", {"x": 5, "y": "Oliver"}]'

A brief note about the input and output. They look very similar, but the input is an object and the output is a string enclosed in single ticks. This means that the double quotes inside that string are characters in the string and are important.
